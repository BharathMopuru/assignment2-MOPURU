# BHARATH KUAMR REDDY MOPURU
I completed my bachlores in Mechanical engineering but reason of choosing ACS is interest in programming languages. This is got from when I first encoutered with C language in my First year of my bachlors, but at that time I had no option of changing  stream and now it is an greate opportunity to study some programming stuff that,s why I choose computer science  as my majors.
